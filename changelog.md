Please make sure to report any bugs and/or visual anomalies
on [Resourcify's GitHub](https://github.com/DeDiamondPro/Resourcify/issues) or in
the [Discord](https://discord.gg/XtAuqsJWby).

- Move downloading worlds to "Create new world" and then press the "Download" tab.
- Add updating support for Datapacks when using a mod
  like [Datapack/Gamerule Menus](https://modrinth.com/mod/packrule-menus).
- After updating a Resource Pack, you are now returned to the pack selection GUI, instead of immediately triggering a
  resource reload.
- Make dependencies open inside Resourcify, instead of opening it in the browser.
- (1.21.4 NeoForge) Fix compatibility with NeoForge 21.4.84-beta and above. (Note: Resourcify now requires NeoForge
  21.4.84-beta or later on 1.21.4).
- Improve scaling in the update GUI.
- Added disabled button colors, these can be changed
  with [themes](https://github.com/DeDiamondPro/Resourcify/blob/master/README.md#theming).
- Fixed an issue where if you have an old version of a pack, and the up-to-date version, Resourcify would still try to
  update the old version.
