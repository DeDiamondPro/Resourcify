- Fixed not being able to read some zips when download worlds
- Improved world extraction handling by locating `level.dat` to determine the folder root.
- (1.21.10) Fix clicking links to other Modrinth projects not opening project and going to main menu instead
- Make images in markdown descriptions use linear scaling, this should improve overall quality of enlarged images
- Update hit boxes of some buttons to make them easier to click (back and forward buttons, search bar and buttons for
  the pages in the project screen)
- Fix a rare crash in the screen that watches your download folder for a manual install
