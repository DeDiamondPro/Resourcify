## Resourcify 1.7.1

- Improve scaling in the update GUI.
- Added disabled button colors, these can be changed
  with [themes](https://github.com/DeDiamondPro/Resourcify/blob/master/README.md#theming).
- Fixed an issue where if you have an old version of a pack, and the up-to-date version, Resourcify would still try to
  update the old version.
