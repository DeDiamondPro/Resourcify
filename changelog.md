Please make sure to report any bugs and/or visual anomalies
on [Resourcify's GitHub](https://github.com/DeDiamondPro/Resourcify/issues) or in
the [Discord](https://discord.gg/XtAuqsJWby).

- Added support for 1.21.8 NeoForge
- Marked VulkanMod as incompatible, this incompatibility lies at how one of the libraries that Resourcify uses works,
  and unfortunately there is not much that can be done about it for now.
- Updated some dependencies
