## Resourcify 1.6.1

### The future

This will be the last version that supports all the versions currently supported by Resourcify,
in the next version only the following version will be supported:

- 1.21.2-1.21.4
- 1.21.0-1.21.1
- 1.20.0-1.20.1

This decision has been made to streamline the development process, the versions that we are continuing to support
account for almost 80% of all downloads over the last 30 days. **After this point, all other versions will only receive
critical updates**, this means if a source API changes or a common crash is found, this will still be fixed. But no new
features will be added.
