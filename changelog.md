## Resourcify 1.7.0

- Add theming support for Resource packs and/or Mod packs, for more info see
  the [readme](https://github.com/DeDiamondPro/Resourcify/blob/master/README.md#theming).
- Add support for resource packs to overwrite Resourcify's textures.
- (1.21.2-4) Fix an issue causing a part of the GUI (or all of it with immediatelyfast) to be drawn behind the
  background.
- Resourcify now requires kotlin 2.0 or above, so for fabric you will need fabric language kotlin version 
  "1.11.0+kotlin.2.0.0" or later, and for forge you will need kotlin for forge version 4.11.0 or later.

In addition, Resourcify's build system has been entirely rewritten using architectury loom and stonecutter, which will
speed up future development of Resourcify.
